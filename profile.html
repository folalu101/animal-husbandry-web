            <hr><h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
                <p>The Shelter Pet Project is the result of a collaborative effort between two leading animal welfare groups, the Humane Society of the United States and Maddie’s Fund, and the leading producer of public service advertising (PSA) campaigns, The Ad Council.</p><br>
                    <p>Our goal is to make shelters the first place potential adopters turn when looking to get a new pet, ensuring that all healthy and treatable pets find loving homes. We do this by breaking down misconceptions surrounding shelter pets and celebrating the unique bond between every shelter pet and parent.</p><br>
                <p>Beginning as a small group of passionate and driven individuals, we have grown to have a impact on countless animals across the world. Every year we enjoy taking a look back on what has been achieved, and its quite something. 

                Year by year, we continues to get stronger and stronger, making the world a better place for animals around the globe. </p>
