                <h3>Our History</h3>
                    <p>With over 40 years of experience in Animal Husbandry and sheltering, we have proven our level of expertise in the sector. With different recognition from the government, public and private enterprises. Pet microchip databases will also be made more accessible under the proposals. There are currently 16 microchipping databases in England, however the Taskforce found that they can be difficult to navigate for pet owners and law enforcement, making it difficult to trace stolen dogs. Under the new proposals a single point of access to all databases will simplify and streamline the system and more robust rules will also be introduced across all of the pet microchipping databases for recording the transfer of dogs to new owners to ensure full traceability.Taken together, these proposals will make it far harder for thieves to steal and sell pets, will make it easier for the police to catch them, and will ensure that the impact on the animal is reflected in the sentences or penalties given to offenders.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">A dog has sharp teeth so that it can eat flesh very easily, it has four legs, two ears, two eyes, a tail, a mouth, and a nose. It is a very clever animal and is very useful in catching thieves. It runs very fast, barks loudly and attacks the strangers.Dogs come in many shapes and sizes. The smallest breeds include the toy and miniature varieties, such as the Toy Poodle, Papillon, Chihuahua, and Shih Tzu. These dogs usually weigh only 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kilograms), or even less. Medium-sized dogs include many of the terriers and spaniels, which weigh in the 10 to 50 pound (4.5 to 23 kilograms) range. Larger still are the retrievers, shepherds, and setters, which often weigh 65 to 100 pounds (30 to 45 kilograms).</p>

                  <p class="card-text"> cat is a furry animal that has a long tail and sharp claws. Cats are often kept as pets.Cats are lions, tigers, and other wild animals in the same family.There are many different breeds of cats, including Abyssinian, Himalayan, Maine Coon, Manx, Persian, Scottish Fold, and Siamese, to name a few. The Cat Fanciers’ Association, which is the world’s largest registry of pedigreed cats, recognizes about 40 distinct breeds. The most familiar cats are the domestic shorthair and the domestic longhair, which are really mixtures of different breeds. Cat breeds differ in looks, coat length, and other characteristics but vary relatively little in size. On average, only 5 to 10 pounds separate the smallest and largest domestic breeds of cats.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">A Sheep is any member of the taxonomic genus Ovis. This group includes five different species, including the Dall Sheep, bighorn Sheep, Mouflon, and more. The domestic Sheep is a separate species of Sheep from the other wild species (Ovis aries). For our purposes, we will focus on the domestic species in this article. Read on to learn about the Sheep.All breeds share a few distinct characteristics. They have hooves on their ends of their feet, and they stand on two primary “toes” rather than a single hoof like a horse. Most breeds have dense fur known as wool. Some breeds also have horns that grow from the tops of their heads.
